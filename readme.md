This project revolves around data of passengers of the RMS Titanic, which was sank during the Titanic incident on the 14-15th of April, 1912.

The objective of this project is to use the data to predict who of the passengers survived, and who didn't.

In the process of working on this project, I performed EDA over the dataset, followed by performing feature engineering to make the dataset compatible to be used as input to various Machine Learning methods.

This project was about using classic ML models, and so, the models I tested out were Support Vector Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, AdaBoost Classifier, GradientBoost Classifier and XGBoost Classifier.
